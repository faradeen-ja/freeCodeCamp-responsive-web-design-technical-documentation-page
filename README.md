# freeCodeCamp-responsive-web-design-technical-documentation-page
In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.



## I decided
to complete the freeCodeCamp responsive web design on top of my other several coding courses I have done so far, and put the projects here. to anyone who likes to learn coding and looking to begin, freeCodeCamp tutorials all easy to grasp and clear systymatic contents beginner friendly to advance. I am glad if this project will help you as a refference to your project. always code code and practice even if you find a completed project. happy <coding!/> responsive web design contents owned by freeCodeCamp
